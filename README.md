# TOP - Landing Page

This is my attempt at recreating TOP landing page. This was the last task of CSS fundementals.
Page was made using a shitton of flexboxes.
Most of it was done from memory of what i learned, only few things that weren't thought yet
had to be googled. For example border radiuses, text decorations.

Overall this project was a success, took me about 3-4hours to make.
